Matlab Application to Organize photos


THIS CODE CONSISTS OF THREE PARTS 

THERE'S 1) TRANSFER LEARNING 
        2) FEATURE EXTRACTION 
        3) PROJ 
        
The first program essentially gives how to inculcate transfer learning into MATLAB framework. The codes are available on Tensorflow and one can get it in the official site of MATLAB

The second program is feature extraction, The code here suggests that an image taken would be parsed through the framework that would essentially split the image into different features and extract essential features that would give out a clarity about what the image represents.

The third program is to integrate all these credentials into a single domain and thus carry out the essential tasks that would form the smart picture gallery.


MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS 

Since this program uses GPU to carry out feature extraction and transfer learning , one must essentially have an NVIDIA GeForce or equivalent GPU to make the results appear faster and more appealing.
